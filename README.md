Food Delivery Website
Project type: Single-page web application (React + CSS)
Short description This is a simple Food Delivery Website I built while following a YouTube tutorial. The app is implemented using React for the UI and plain CSS for styling. It demonstrates fundamental React concepts (components, props, state) and basic layout and styling techniques.
Features
Home / Landing section with hero image and tagline
Menu / Items list (food cards) displaying name, price, and short description
Add-to-cart functionality (client-side only)
Cart overview and basic item quantity adjustment
Responsive layout that adapts to mobile and desktop widths
Simple CSS styling (no CSS framework)
Note: This project is primarily a learning exercise following a YouTube tutorial. It is not production-ready and does not include a backend, authentication, payment gateway, or persistent database.
